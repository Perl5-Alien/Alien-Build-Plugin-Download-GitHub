  - Update documentation.
  - Changed the default of the prefer property from 1 to 0.
  - When prefer property is set to 0, a default prefer hook is added, which
    leaves the list of releases unsorted.  This is different from the
    Download Negotiator plugin.  Since GitHub usually returns a
    sorted list of releases this will frequently be what you want.
